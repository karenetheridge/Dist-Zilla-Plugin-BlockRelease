=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::BlockRelease - Prevent a release from occurring

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

    [BlockRelease]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin, when loaded, prevents C<dzil release> from completing. It is
useful to include temporarily, while developing (perhaps while using some
development-only requirements or code, to guard against an accidental release.

Load it last to allow all other C<BeforeRelease> plugins to still perform
their checks, or first to stop these pre-release checks from occurring.

=for Pod::Coverage BUILD before_release release
